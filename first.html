  <h1>The International Society for Universal Dialogue</h1>
  <h1>ISUD XII World Congress</h1>
  <p>PHILOSOPHY IN AN AGE OF CRISIS&#58; CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS</p>
  <p>Lima&#44; Peru July 10-15&#44; 2018</p>
  <p>The hosting institution was the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú&#44; PUCP)&#46;</p>
  <p>The goal of this World Congress is to promote dialogue concerning various crucial philosophical issues in today&#39;s world and to explore the role of philosophy in our complicated times&#46; The world we live in today faces many urgent issues that require sustained and productive cross-cultural dialogue&#46; The ideals of global peace and security remain elusive while a sense of uncertainty pervades the dominant institutions of contemporary life&#46; Traditional human values underlying our social and political institutions are continually transformed by new developments in information technology&#44; digitalization&#44; artificial intelligence&#44; and the drive for economic efficiency&#46; Although the globalization of trade and technology has brought people together as never before&#44; our differing outlooks&#44; habits&#44; and ideologies continue to separate us&#46;</p>
  <p>As philosophers&#44; we must neither shut ourselves in ivory towers nor indulge ourselves with armchair philosophy&#46; We must face the issues that define our moment in history&#46; Our times demand that we&#44; as philosophers&#44; work to foster intellectual insight&#44; imagination&#44; social responsibility&#44; and justice&#46; Therefore&#44; the International Society for Universal Dialogue issues a call for papers and proposals for panels for the 12th World Congress of ISUD on the general theme of “Philosophy in an Age of Crisis&#44; Challenges and Prospects”&#44; with the following sub-themes&#44;</p>
